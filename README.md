Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm just starting my journey in data analytics and diving into the world of data and code. 
I'm always curious about learning new things and love working on interesting ideasâ€”whether it's data-driven insights, automation, or something completely unexpected!
Right now, I'm exploring Python, SQL, and data visualization, but I'm also open to experimenting with other technologies. 
Feel free to check out my projects, and let's connect if you're into data, tech, or just fun side projects! ðŸš€
